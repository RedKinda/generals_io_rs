# Generals.io

Implementation of a bot for the game [generals.io](https://generals.io/). It uses MCTS to search for the best move but is relatively dumb.
To tweak parameters, check out `get_score()` in `state.rs`, as well as the `constants.rs` file.

Put `USERID`, `USERNAME` and `GAMEID` (optional) into your `.env` file to run the bot.

Enjoy
